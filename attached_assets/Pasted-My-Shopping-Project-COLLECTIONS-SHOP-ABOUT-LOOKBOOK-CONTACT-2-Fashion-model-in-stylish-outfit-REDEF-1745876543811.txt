About Me
I'm Rahul Krishna, a passionate Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in building scalable, user-centric web applications and AI-driven solutions. This project showcases my expertise in modern React development, demonstrating advanced concepts and best practices in frontend architecture.

This shopping platform was built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to demonstrate responsive design principles and modern UI patterns. The backend utilizes Express with PostgreSQL integration via Drizzle ORM to provide a complete fullstack implementation.

Throughout my career, I've focused on creating accessible, performant applications with thoughtful UX and clean, maintainable code. I enjoy solving complex problems and staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies and best practices.

Looking for a software engineer who can transform caffeine into code with remarkable efficiency? You've found your match! With my 5+ years of crafting scalable, user-centric applications, I'm like a Swiss Army knife for your tech stack—except I won't break when you need me most. My React components are so clean they practically review themselves, and my TypeScript is so strictly typed it makes TypeScript itself blush. I'm fluent in frontend, backend, and can translate "impossible deadline" into "challenge accepted" faster than you can say "production bug."
